    <p id="diary">I was in a room with two friends that I have not talked to for a long time. The room was painted in white, with black stairs leading to a red door. I went up the stairs and rotated the handle, but it was stuck. <br><br>A locked room.<br><br>
I looked around the room and there was nothing else. This is a completely white, empty room. At this point I heard some buzzing sounds behind me. I turned around and saw my two friends talking to each other. Their voices were so blurred that I could not catch a word, and they seemed to be indifferent to the fact that we were locked. Then I stared up at the ceiling. How strange it was that the room was bright without any light in it.</p>

    <p id="diary">I was standing in a train station. It was in a simple modern style with rectilinear structure. I heard someone keeping repeating the word “station” in English. <br><br>Station, station, station, station, station...<br><br> I felt like I just ended something big, and I met some other people. But the memory of their faces was lost. <br><br>All I had was the sound of “station” all around me.<br><br>

    <p id="diary">There was a cabinet in the room, and some clothes hangers next to it. My black mug was on the cabinet, and I recognized that it was my bedroom in my apartment. <br><br>Everything was in their usual place, but there were so many mirrors. So many that I began to have a feeling of insecurity from exposing myself to them.<br><br> Did I look into the mirrors? I did not remember.<br><br> Then I noticed that above the largest mirror there were two switches that were too high for me to reach. <br><br>What were they for? I kept having this question in my mind as I wandered around.

    <p id="diary">I was walking in a park that looked very similar to Central Park. The trees and roads took me back to New York. I walked down a road to a small lake, and found a bench nearby to sit on. I looked into the lake and saw countless thick black “ribbons” moving rapidly. They were twisted together like snakes, but I could not tell whether they were living creatures or not.
