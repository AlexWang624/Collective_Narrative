    <p id="diary">I was in a room with two friends that I have not talked to for a long time. The room was painted in white, with black stairs leading to a red door. I went up the stairs and rotated the handle, but it was stuck. <br><br>This is a
      locked room.<br><br>
      I looked around the room and there was nothing else. This is a completely white, empty room. At this point I heard some buzzing sounds behind me. I turned around and saw my two friends talking to each other. Their voices were so blurred that I
      could not catch a word, and they seemed to be indifferent to the fact that we were locked. Then I stared up at the ceiling. How strange it was that the room was bright without any light in it.</p>

    <p id="diary">I was standing in a train station. The station was in a simple modern style with rectilinear structure. I heard someone keeping repeating the word “station” in English. <br><br>Station, station, station, station, station...<br><br>
      I felt like I just ended something big, and I met some other people in this dream. But the memory of their identites and our interactions was lost. <br><br>All I remembered was the sound of “station” all around me.<br><br>

    <p id="diary">I saw a cabinet, and some clothes hangers next to it. My black mug was on the cabinet, which reminded me that this place was my bedroom in my apartment. <br><br>Everything was in their usual place. Everything except the strange
      mirrors around the cabinet, which were not suppposed to be in my room. A large rectangular mirror was hung above the cabinet, a smaller one was placed on it, and a round dressing mirror by the side of it. So many mirrors that I began to have a
      feeling of insecurity from exposing myself to them.<br><br> Did I look into the mirrors? I did not remember.<br><br> Then I noticed that above the largest mirror there were two switches that were too high for me to reach. <br><br>What were they
      for? I kept having this question in my mind as I wandered around in this room that I was both familiar and unfamiliar with.

    <p id="diary">I was walking in a park that looked very similar to Central Park. The trees and roads took me back to New York City. <br><br>I walked down a road to a small lake, and found a bench nearby to sit on. I looked into the lake and saw countless thick
      black “ribbons” moving rapidly. They were twisted together like snakes, but I could not tell whether they were living creatures or not.

    <p id="diary">Trees.<br><br> I was walking in trees in beautiful golden sunset.<br><br>This drean was very peaceful, like a meditation, although the part that I still remembered when I woke up was very short.<br><br>

    <p id="diary">I dreamt of the house that I lived when I was a kid. I dreamt of the table where my dad put his orchid on. <br><br>I dreamt of a plastic bottle of my favorite drink.<br><br>I dreamt of an apple. My mom always prepared an apple before I went to school when I was a kid.<br><br>And I dreamt of the bamboos in the house.<br><br>
